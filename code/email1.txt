Subject: Request for Loan Extension  

Dear Loan Servicing Team,  

I hope this email finds you well. Due to unforeseen financial difficulties, I am requesting an extension on my loan repayment for an additional three months.  

Please let me know the process and any additional documentation required.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Best regards,  
John Doe
